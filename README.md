# Raspberry-Pi-Project
Raspberry Pi Smoke &amp; Gas Alarm System | Backend, Frontend, Threads &amp; GPIO


A smart smoke and gas alarm system using Raspberry Pi! This project combines a Python-based HTTP server (backend) with a web interface (frontend) styled with CSS and powered by JavaScript. It uses GPIO to monitor a gas sensor and control an LED and buzzer, while threading ensures smooth real-time performance. This project integrates hardware with software for a responsive, web-controlled safety system.
